                    Many of us have the habit of collecting a lot of things. Useful or not, we like to collect various
                    things in our homes
                    in the hope that one day we might use them. This is fine up to a point until we realize that we have
                    nowhere to store
                    them, and our house becomes less and less roomy.

                    No matter how big or small the space we live in is, when it comes to storage, we all have
                    difficulties in finding the
                    most suitable and at the same time fashionable place where to put things because smart storage does
                    not always mean that
                    everything has to be hidden.
                    With the right strategies, you can live small and store well. We believe that creativity is the
                    answer to many of life’s
                    problems, especially when we talk about a house.
                    The more we think outside the ‘walls’, the more we'll find ways to make our limited space work for
                    us.

                    anything to do with

                    A very popular design these days is given by these cubbyholes which can be both incorporated into
                    the wall since the
                    construction of the space, but which can also be found in <a

                    They are used both to store things and to delimit spaces when you want to separate certain areas in

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Alcoves are the perfect space to build shelves and storage units which will look wonderful in your
                    rooms, without taking
                    up much space and are a great storage idea for a contemporary scheme. Also, make the most of an
                    awkward recess in the
                    wall and with a simple but clever design for alcoves you can transform that space into something
                    comfortable and
                    practical like a narrow bookcase on its side to create an alcove bench for seating and storage. Put
                    storage baskets
                    under the bench, and on top of it, you can put some pillows and beds to create an ideal reading
                    space.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    If you want to be even more practical, instead of a bench you can incorporate a desk, thus turning
                    that area into a
                    mini-office.

                    Sometimes, in small spaces, wall cabinets can seem like they take up too much space, but if we still
                    have a bit of extra
                    wall space, a pair of floating shelves are an excellent idea.
                    You can make the most of the potential of these shelves to store things by putting a few hooks under
                    the bottom shelf
                    for hanging towels, mugs, utensils and other daily essentials for easy access to your most-used
                    items.

                    One of the most clever small space organization idea is using the back of doors. Most of the time
                    this idea is put into
                    practice only with the bathroom doors where we hang towels, robes or clothes, but All doors provide
                    valuable storage
                    space in small rooms.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    For example, in kitchens, you can use the back of the door to hang the cleaning products so that the
                    little ones can't
                    reach or you can hang a spice rack. Also, the back of the door in the room can be very useful for
                    hanging a mirror,
                    accessories or bags

                    As we said, when we live in a small space, creativity is the best solution to solve all our
                    problems. The more we think
                    outside the box, the more we will discover places to store that we didn't even think about until
                    then. For example, the
                    space around a door is a wasted space if we don't use it. By building some deep shelves you can
                    create a super library
                    above the door, or even decorate your room with a few lovely green plants or accessories.

                    them, they’re a perfect spot for plants, or any other small objects you can think of. Also, the
                    space under windows can
                    be very valuable to put a closet to hide different things.

                    For such situations, the smartest solution is to use a piece of furniture that separates the spaces
                    and also creates a
