                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Planning a bathroom renovation and wondering how much it will end up costing? We try and breakdown
                    the costs of a bathroom renovation as much as possible so you know how to budget your home
                    improvement project.

                </p>
                <h3 class="post-subtitle">First of all, why should you renovate your bathroom?</h3>
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    A bathroom refurbishment is a big project to take on but it also comes with a lot of benefits. There
                    are plenty of reasons to want to renovate a bathroom but we will list only a couple of them:
                <ol class="post-paragraph">
                    <li>The bathroom is old and shows signs of wear. In this situation you are refurbishing the bathroom
                        for you and your family. The bathroom is the most used room in your home so you want it to be
                        comfortable, good looking and practical.</li>
                    <li>You’ve just purchased your home and want to put your personal touch on it’s design. When
                        purchasing a new house, it’s usually done the way the former owner liked and this, most of the
                        time, does not match with your style and taste. Modernising the bathroom of your new house will
                        make it feel more like home.</li>
                    <li>You are thinking of your home’s value. Bathroom renovations have a very good return on
                        investment and will increase your home’s valuation if you are thinking of selling or
                        remortgaging.</li>
                    <li>There are more reasons to renovate your bathroom, including leaky and potentially dangerous
                        plumbing and electrics, carpeted flooring and more “bad design and practical choices”.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Bathroom renovation cost and factors that influence it</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The cost for labour and construction materials for a bathroom renovation is between £4,500 and
                    £7,500.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    There are a lot of factors to take into consideration and decisions to be made when quoting for a
                    bathroom renovation project. Each of them will influence this cost, with some projects going even
                    higher than the above mentioned threshold because of their complexity. Let’s take a look at these
                    below:
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    <span class="post-subtitle-sub">1. The size of the bathroom.</span> <br />

                    We usually characterise bathrooms into small, medium and large bathrooms. The bigger the space, the
                    more materials and time will go into renovating it thus the price will be higher.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    <span class="post-subtitle-sub">2. The layout of the bathroom</span> <br>

                    You have 2 choices here. Keep the layout as it is or change it by moving the position of the
                    bathroom fixtures around the bathroom to better manage the space.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The first option will obviously be cheaper as it is less time consuming. There will still be a need
                    to adjust the current plumbing for the new bathroom fixtures but this is less intensive labour.
                    Keeping the same layout is usually a good way to take down the cost of your bathroom refurbishment.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The second option will take the price up as moving the plumbing for the fixtures in different
                    positions is difficult work that requires more time and materials. If your budget allows it,
                    changing the layout of your bathroom is beneficial as it allows you to personalise the space and
                    utilise it more effectively.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    <span class="post-subtitle-sub">3. Bathroom tiling</span> <br>

                    The way you decide to tile your new bathroom is another big factor that drives the price of your
                    renovation up or down.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Since the bathroom is a wet room, you will need to tile certain spaces, usually those in direct
                    contact with water (i.e. shower enclosure, bathroom enclosure etc.) and the floor.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Depending on preference, you can opt for:
                <ul class="post-paragraph">
                    <li>Full height tiling in the whole bathroom</li>
                    <li>Full height tiling in the bath / shower enclosure and halfway on the rest of the walls</li>
                    <li>Full height in the bath / shower enclosure and splash back tiling or just decorate the rest of
                        the room</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The more tiling you do, the more time it will take and so the more the cost of the bathroom
                    renovation
                    will go up.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Another important fact to take into consideration when choosing your bathroom tiles is, tile size
                    and pattern.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    There are tons of tile sizes and even more shapes and patterns you can opt for. But you have to know
                    that the easiest and cheapest option when tiling is to go for simple, big ceramic tiles. These are
                    easy to install and can look great if chosen to match your bathroom fixtures.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Although using small mosaic tiles, hexagonal tiles, weird and complicated patterns or materials (
                    cement tiles ) can make your bathroom stand out, this will definitely add to the cost of your
                    bathroom refurbishment.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    <span class="post-subtitle-sub">4. Bathroom electrics</span> <br>

                    In terms of electrics in a bathroom you have to consider the following:

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    On the low end of the cost, you will most likely have included the replacement of the existing light
                    or spotlights and the replacement of the extractor fan.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    However, if any of the items above are not already wired in the bathroom and you’d like to add them,
                    this will increase the overall labour cost.

                    When refurbishing your bathroom, you will need to at least paint the ceiling if you opt for the full
                    height tiling option that we discussed about above. If going with a different tiling option, there
                    will be walls to paint as well.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Depending on the state of the walls and ceiling, just filling in small cracks is usually already
                    included in the cost, but there are situations when the walls and/or the ceiling are seriously
                    cracked and also need to be plastered or plaster-boarded in order to obtain a high quality finish.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    As you can imagine, the need to plasterboard and plaster will drive the cost up.

                    A lot of companies offer bathroom design as a service to their customers.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">At Better Homes Studio, we have an in-house interior design team, enabling

                    If you don’t have inspiration, are too busy to plan and manage your bathroom renovation or are

                    The design package includes mood boards based on your tastes for the fixtures and tiles that will go

                    committing to it, and a supply service in which we will source your items, manage deliveries and
                    refunds ( if needed ) on your behalf.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Although this is not a big cost, if getting your bathroom professionally designed is something that
                    you’d like, this will be added on top of the labour quote.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Bathroom fixtures and tiles</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The first major cost of a bathroom renovation is the labour, which we discussed about above. The
                    second is purchasing your new bathroom suite and tiles.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Bathroom suites vary greatly in price depending on style, brand and colour ( chrome, black or brass
                    are the most common ones ).
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    You also have quality ranges from low end to super luxury with prices from £450 to outrageously
                    expensive.
                </p>

                <ul class="post-paragraph">
                    <li>Low end bathroom suite - starting from £450</li>
                    <li>Mid range bathroom suite - starting from £1,800</li>
                    <li>Luxury bathroom suite - starting from £4,000 going to more than £30,000</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Choosing the right bathroom suite is really important for both your budget and for the life span of
                    your bathroom.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Although you can get full bathroom suites from as little as £450, we generally don’t recommend them
                    as they are not great quality and you risk having them fail not long after you’ve purchased them.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    For most clients, we recommend getting a mid range bathroom suite.
                </div>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Conclusion</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The cost of your bathroom renovation project is comprised of 2 main items:
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Labour</li>
                        <li>Bathroom suite and tiles</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    For labour, you can expect to pay anywhere between £4,500 and £7,500, the price being influenced by
                    different choices you make when planning your new bathroom.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The above is the median cost you can expect to pay for a bathroom renovation but this can vary
                    depending on your location, the companies reputation, time of year etc.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    For your new bathroom suite and tiles, you can expect to pay between £450 and basically infinite £’s
                    ( ok, maybe not infinite ). Our recommendation is to try and get a good mid range bathroom suite as
                    these are usually reasonably priced ( starting at around £1,800 ) and are quality enough to work
                    until you next decide it’s time to refurbish your bathroom again.
                </p>
