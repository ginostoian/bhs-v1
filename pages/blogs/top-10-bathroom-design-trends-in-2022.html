                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Are you trying to find new ideas for your bathroom? Specialists have predicted bathroom design
                    trends
                    for 2022. Before beginning a project in 2022, it's a good idea to look at what will be popular in
                    bathrooms next year to make sure your design remains current. In recent years, trends for bathrooms
                    have
                    evolved to include a wide range of different designs and colours that were previously reserved for
                    more
                    utilitarian spaces, allowing you to express yourself more in your design than ever before.

                    We enlisted the help of some of the best bathroom designers in the business to give us a heads-up on
                    some of the hottest design ideas for 2022. Here are 10 of our favourites.

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Do I Need to Follow Bathroom Trends?</h3>
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Bathroom trends don't often go out of style as fast as those in other home areas. Consequently, it's
                    a
                    good idea to keep this in mind while evaluating whether or not to commit to a trend. If you're going
                    to
                    make a selection based on your preferences, you'll have to consider current trends. Grey grout and
                    White
                    metro tiles, considered standard in bathroom decor, were formerly outmoded; yet, some fads are more
                    durable than others.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">How Do Bathroom Renovation and Refurbishment Work?</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    When it comes to bathroom remodelling, you want to make sure that you do everything you can to
                    protect
                    your property and the environment. If you’re not taking steps such as protecting the flooring, then
                    there is a high chance that your bathroom will become a mess. Bathroom renovation and refurbishment
                    can
                    be a great way to help protect both of these factors. This type of renovation can also save you
                    money on
                    your remodelling project. In addition, bathroom renovation and refurbishment can help improve the
                    appearance of your bathroom.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Bathroom renovation: This is a popular trend in the bathroom industry, as people are looking for
                    ways to
                    update their bathrooms without scrapping everything. Many people are interested in renovating their
                    bathrooms for a few reasons: to save on money, make them more comfortable, or improve the appearance
                    of
                    the room.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Bathroom refurbishment: This is a similar style of renovation, but it's used for updating the look
                    and
                    function of an existing bathroom. Often, this involves adding new features or changing the
                    bathroom's
                    layout to be more comfortable and organized.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">Bathroom contractor – These days, there are a lot of companies that offer
                    bathroom renovation though you should always do your research before hiring a bathroom refurbishment
                    specialist.</div>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Green in Bathroom</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Large colour forecasting companies such as Dulux and Pantone make forecasts every year about the
                    hues
                    that will characterize the following year. However, the reality may be considerably different from
                    projections. In contrast to Dulux's Blue Skies and Pantone's Very Peri, searches for sage and forest
                    green have increased by 23% in the last year. It's a good idea to use green in the bathroom,
                    particularly in these warmer shades. The colour contrasts nicely with brass and copper accents and
                    lends
                    a sense of cosiness to the bathroom as a whole.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Open Showers
                </h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Is the standalone tub's heyday over in 2022? Bathroom merchants say there's a growing preference for
                    a
                    particular sort of shower. In addition to moving away from smaller cubicles and toward considerably
                    larger enclosures, more consumers opt for walk-in showers and wet rooms over bathtubs, according to
                    Sanctuary Bathrooms' Showroom Supervisor and 3D Bathroom Designer.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">Use wet rooms and floors to make the most of your available space while
                    also
                    making your house more adaptable in the event of ageing family members or guests.</div>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Stone Finishes Statement</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    It is fashionable to use large swaths of marble or other stone, yet doing so may be prohibitively
                    costly
                    even for those with the most significant budgets. According to a tile industry expert, "from
                    marble-effect to onyx effect, stone effect designs are making their mark in the world of tiles this
                    season". "Stone effect tiles are less expensive than real stone because they are typically made of
                    porcelain or ceramic.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Creative Lighting of Bathroom</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Though elaborate and intriguing bathroom lighting concepts have been around for a while, in
                    2022,
                    you
                    can hope to see even more of them on the market. If you're planning to utilize these new designs
                    in
                    your
                    bathroom, you'll need a higher IP rating because of the elevated risk of electrocution. For your
                    bathroom remodel in 2022, one of your top priorities should be to include a variety of lighting
                    kinds
                    and styles to create a more complex lighting system.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Ceramics Coloured for Basins and Baths
                </h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    It's hard to imagine avocado green or whisper pink, but we're already seeing a lot of interest
                    in
                    brightly coloured porcelain sinks and toilets, which were popular in the 1980s and 1990s. More
                    and

                    people are opting for brighter and more colourful bathroom decor as an alternative to the
                    traditional
                    antiseptic white boxes. However, will these bathroom designs be able to withstand the test of
                    time?
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Choose a more substantial statement piece instead of the whole suite of colourful ceramics if
                    you're
                    worried about the bathroom's lifespan. If you're wary of statement basins in the future, you can
                    quickly
                    and cheaply change them. They provide a lot of impact without taking up too much room.

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Biophilic Design and Wellbeing</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    For physical and psychological reasons, health has taken on critical importance in the home.
                    This
                    isn't
                    much of a surprise, given recent occurrences. As more people worked from home or educated their
                    children
                    at home, there was an uptick in the number of homeowners and designers building places that
                    served
                    as
                    respites. As more individuals work from home, the need for a peaceful haven in the house hasn't
                    lessened, thanks to a newfound appreciation for the simple things.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    In the bathroom, biophilic design means designing a space designed to stimulate health benefits.
                    This
                    might involve adapting natural materials like water and mud into the home facade or bathroom
                    décor.

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Spa Bathrooms and Steam Rooms</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    No one can deny the popularity of treating one's house like a spa day after day. It's like
                    having
                    your
                    spa in your own home, with features like built-in Bluetooth speakers, heated seats, and
                    luxurious
                    finishes. This way, you can take the idea of "being able to relax anywhere" and make it
                    available at
                    your fingertips.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Fluted Features</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    As designers and businesses introduce new fluted goods, you may expect to see them more often in
                    bathroom design by 2022. Fluted designs have been buzzing about interior design for the last
                    year.

                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Tiles and New fluted basins are a huge trend for 2022, even though fluted bathroom furniture is
                    readily
                    available. Wall panelling ideas with fluted finishes may also be used in a modern bathroom.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Terracotta Bathrooms</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">Blues and greens are traditional choices for smooth bathroom colour
                    schemes, but a variety of earthy
                    tones are quickly gaining popularity as well. Terracotta is one of the most popular colours and
                    materials for the bathroom right now, along with taupes, beiges, and browns.</p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Terracotta, a new colour trend for 2022, has a calming effect on the house, like green. Cement
                    tiles
                    may
                    be used in the bathroom, as can towels and bathmats in a warm apricot tone to mimic the look and
                    feel of
                    a Mediterranean home.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Period Styles with Mixing Modern</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The popularity of traditional bathroom designs continues to grow, but there are methods to get a
                    classic
                    aesthetic without it becoming cheesy. One way to do it right is to give a traditional bathroom
                    suite
                    a
                    modern touch with colour choices while also honouring its origins.
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    This style is all about how well you can merge the two types. Consumers can express themselves
                    in a
                    truly unique way for the first time due to their bathroom design. Making it work is all about
                    the
                    ingredients you use. Take a moment to remember that opposites attract! In this traditional
                    bathroom,
                    the
                    faucet has been updated to be more contemporary and streamlined in appearance—classic faucets on
                    a
                    cutting-edge sink design.
