                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    If we want to give a rigid and basic definition of a smart house, we can say that it is a residence
                    that uses
                    internet-connected devices to automate and control different aspects of a house, such as security,
                    lighting, temperature
                    and appliances. The benefits of a smart home include increased energy efficiency, improved security,
                    and greater
                    convenience.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    In reality, there is no concrete definition, but we can consider a smart home one that uses smart
                    devices to control and
                    automate household functions often through voice commands and mobile apps.
                </div>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The benefits of such a house are energy efficiency, security, entertainment and comfort, all these
                    benefits helping to
                    save time and money. The top benefit of a smart home is that you can remotely control and monitor
                    home devices.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    'Smart technology is constantly evolving to help people live their everyday lives simpler as well as
                    creating new ways
                    to keep our homes safer and easier to control,' says Naeem Adam, tech expert at <a

                    To understand how trendy these smart homes are and how big they have become since they make our
                    lives much easier, the
                    most accessible example of smart technology that I think most of you have heard of is Amazon’s Alexa
                    which can control
                    smart devices by voice control. They have now connected more than 300 million smart home devices
                    globally, and each one
                    has the capability of controlling so much more.

                    1. How to Choose your Smart Devices
                </h2>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    There are thousands of ways to automate your home, but we suggest starting slowly with one or two
                    smart devices before
                    gradually adding more. There are several factors to consider when you want to buy smart devices for
                    your home like <span class='accent-word'>,
                        setup, lifestyle and research</span>.
                </div>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    When it comes to technology, the sky's the limit, both for what they can do, but also for their
                    costs. For this reason,
                    it is very good to know what your limit is and to establish a budget. In addition to the costs, you
                    must also take into
                    account your level of training in terms of smart devices and how familiar you are with them. These
                    are meant to make
                    your life easier, not to complicate it
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Before deciding to purchase a smart device, do some research about it, read customer opinions,
                    independent reviews, and
                    buyer guides and always adapt what you buy to your needs and lifestyle. What someone likes and is

                    With the rise of the Internet and smartphones, smart homes began to take off, their biggest
                    advantage being that they
                    can be controlled remotely. Today, there are countless smart home devices on the market, from
                    thermostats and security
                    cameras to door locks and light bulbs. We cannot say what would be the best smart device for a home
                    because it depends a
                    lot on the needs of each person and what they want to achieve with that device, but we highlight
                    some products for smart
                    home beginners that are easy to use, affordable, or too good to pass up.

                    Smart lighting systems are internet-connected devices that allow homeowners to control and automate
                    their home's lights.
                    They can be programmed to turn off lights when they're not needed, such as when everyone has left
                    the house and can even
                    be controlled remotely via smartphone apps.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Smart lighting systems use sensors and algorithms to monitor when lights are needed and when they're
                    not. They can also
                    be controlled remotely via smartphone apps, so you can turn off lights that you left on by accident
                    or turn on lights
                    when you're away from home. Some smart lighting systems also include features such as voice control
                    and the ability to
                    set schedules and scenes, such as "movie mode" or "dinner party mode."

                        include Philips Hue</a>, LIFX, and Cree Connected. These systems typically include a hub
                    that connects to your home's Wi-Fi network and can control multiple light bulbs, allowing you to
                    easily control the
                    lighting in different rooms of your home.

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    Smart light bulbs are one of the easiest and cheapest ways to start automating your home. Because
                    smart bulbs are LED,
                    they can use anywhere from 75 to 90% less energy than your old bulbs. They also last for up to 25
                    years, which should
                    save you even more money.

                    when you're not or you can set it to work with an automatic timer, which is very useful for example
                    when it comes to
                    holiday decorations so that they automatically turn on when the sun goes down and even turn off when

                    Smart plugs can be easily used to eliminate wasted energy, so these devices can transform your home
                    not only into a
                    smart one but also into an eco-friendly green home. Smart plugs use about 1-2 Watts of power. Your
                    energy bill is
                    measured in kilowatts per hour. That’s 1,000 Watts to 1 kWh. So, 1 watt of power can translate to
                    8.76 kWh of
                    electricity over one year which means a lot of potential energy saved and also a decrease in

                    the garden. Some

                    If you consider that you have enough basic smart devices in your home, but still want to add
                    something more, we
                    recommend that you consider solar panels and energy storage batteries to help manage the spiralling
                    energy costs.

                    If you want to start with lower costs and familiarize yourself with this solar energy production

                    sell affordable solar panels to charge lights, cameras and sensors.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Another great way to reduce energy costs is storage batteries. These batteries are charged using
                    portable solar panels
                    and have a capacity that can charge a house full of phones, laptops, tablets and gadgets.

                    Does a smart home have added value?
                </h2>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    According to <a href="https://www.comparethemarket.com/home-insurance/content/smart-homes/"
                        target="_blank">research from Compare the Market</a>, 51% of Brits are willing to pay up to
                    £2500 more for a
                    home that has smart technology
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Relatively, it may seem like a small amount, but a house that uses smart elements and devices will
                    impress potential
                    customers much more and will sell faster. It should be taken into account that even a smart doorbell
                    that does not cost
                    more than £100 can impress, as well as smart LED bulbs can make a very good impression considering
                    the current energy
                    context.

                    Take advantage of any gadget that can help you save time and money. Smart homes are becoming more
                    and more popular with
                    the technology that is always evolving and improving. They offer a wide range of benefits, from
                    increased energy
                    efficiency and security to improved convenience and control. By planning and budgeting for a smart

                    right devices, and installing and setting them up, you can enjoy all the benefits that smart home
