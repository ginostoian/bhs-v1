                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    It might not seem like it but the bathroom is one of the most important rooms in your home. Think
                    about
                    it.
                    It's the
                    place where you get ready, where you clean yourself and where you "meditate"..cough!
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Because of its importance to the whole family, the bathroom should not only look pretty but also be
                    functional.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">Did you know that a refurbished bathroom increases the sell value of a
                    house?</div>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    For the above reasons, some people are renovating their bathrooms every 5 years or so. Others only
                    renovate
                    when their
                    budgets allow them to do so.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Either way, renovating a bathroom is not an easy task. It is a costly endeavour that will require
                    your
                    attention if you
                    wish to get the best results.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Choosing the right contractor for your bathroom refurbishment project is crucial as they will be the
                    people
                    in charge of
                    making your dream bathroom come true. The more experience they have, the fewer problems will occur
                    during
                    the project
                    and this will make the process much easier for you.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Below we will list some things you should keep in mind when you are hiring a company to manage your
                    bathroom
                    renovation
                    project.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">1. Check the contractors' experience</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    In building, experience is very important and is what sets contractors apart. A company or a sole
                    trader
                    that has
                    completed 50 bathroom renovations will be much better at spotting potential problems with the
                    project in
                    advance, than
                    someone who has worked and completed 3 projects. The more experienced the contractor the more advice
                    he
                    can
                    offer you
                    when making important decisions like e.g. 'what type of paint to use', 'problems with layout
                    changes',
                    'water pressure
                    problems that may arise when changing bathroom fittings'.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The best way to check a contractor's experience is by looking over their online presence. They will
                    usually
                    have
                    different profiles and accounts with reviews that showcase the projects that they worked on. If the
                    contractor worked
                    with someone you know, even better, ask that person about the experience they've had with them.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">2. Read the quote thoroughly</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The company that you are planning to hire should always send you a written proposal usually called a
                    quote.
                    This should
                    have their details, the date the quote has been written, the services that are being quoted and
                    their
                    respective prices
                    and what else is included in the price.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    It is very important to read the quote carefully and understand exactly what you are paying for as
                    this
                    is
                    usually where
                    you could end up getting burned.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The quotes provided by <span class="accent-word">Better Homes Studio</span> state exactly the
                    materials that are included in the
                    price,
                    the
                    materials
                    that the client is expected to purchase, the price for each service and the total of the services
                    plus
                    the
                    VAT. We also
                    have a disclaimer for the client that any service required that is not present in the quote will
                    have to
                    be
                    priced
                    separately.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">3. The quote should not cost</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    There are some situations where companies go the extra mile when quoting and offer the client 3D
                    renders
                    and
                    whatnot and
                    that quote will cost you upfront, which I think is fair.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    You should raise an eyebrow when a company or sole trader tries to charge you for a simple, normal
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    At <span class="accent-word">Better Homes Studio</span> we try and make the quoting process as easy
                    as possible for the client. With
                    this in
                    mind we
                    offer a couple of options to get your bathroom refurbishment quote:
                    - on-site visit with an estimator
                    - zoom or facetime call with an estimator
                    - easy and quick online bathroom quotation form
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">4. Check their availability</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Sometimes companies are booked for months even though they are quoting for new projects. Always
                    discuss
                    when
                    you would
                    like to start your bathroom renovation to check if they have teams available for that period.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Connected to this is that you should always ask your contractor to estimate the time it will take
                    them
                    to
                    complete the
                    project. The answer to this question will let you know if the contractor knows what he's doing or
                    not.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    A bathroom renovation usually takes between 10 and 16 days to complete depending on the difficulty.
                    If
                    you
                    have someone
                    telling you that they will complete your bathroom in 3 days, that is a massive red flag.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">5. Always ask your contractor if they offer any guarantee</h3>

                <div class="post-highlight">Guarantees are very important especially when talking about bathroom
                    refurbishments.</div>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    A lot of the time things do go wrong especially over time. A leak can appear at some point, grouting
                    can
                    wear off,
                    silicone might need to be reapplied etc. If these problems appear due to the workmanship of the
                    contractor
                    he should be
                    liable to come and fix them free of charge for some time after the project has been completed.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    <span class="accent-word">Better Homes Studio</span> offers a 2-year Bathroom Fitting guarantee to

                    additional cost to you.
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    If the contractor passes all the above tests, you most likely found one of the few good ones and
                    your
                    bathroom
                    renovation project will be swift and painless.
