                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Get ready for even more home improvement activity in 2022 if you thought 2021 was busy. It is
                    anticipated that expenditure on home improvements will rise by 9% in the first quarter of this year
                    and by another 8.8% in the second quarter. It's time to make some preparations. The more time you
                    give yourself to choose a contractor, schedule a start date, purchase supplies, and get financing,
                    the more likely your renovation will be completed on schedule.
                </p>
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    And now, we can begin the most exciting part of any remodelling project: the design. Your home
                    makeover should enhance the property's worth and appeal to your sense of style and way of life. We
                    should expect to see these ten design trends for 2022 popping up on every Pinterest board in the
                    coming months.
                </p>
                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Coloured Kitchen Cabinets</h3>
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Don't worry. The white cupboards are out. That's it; we're done with you! You can't possibly be
                    helpful to anybody. The time of neutral tones is ended, and bold colours are coming back. The more
                    time we spend at home, the more we appreciate the freedom to express our individuality via the
                    decor. Paint the cupboards purple if that's your favorite color. 
                    The beautiful cabinet hues in European kitchens have caught the attention of our design team. Maria
                    Martin, an interior designer, suggests going with earth tones like greens, creams, taupes, and even
                    brownish pinks.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Convert a Spare room into Office</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Yes, we had anticipated returning to the office together in 2021, but then Omicron came along and
                    changed everything. If you now work in an office, you should prepare yourself for the possibility
                    that you may one day have to work from home by setting up a dedicated place in your house.
                </p>
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    A multi-purpose area is a good compromise if you don't want to devote a whole room to your home
                    office. The most typical variant is a combination kitchen table/home office.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Large master bathrooms</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    A "main bathroom" is a very recent invention. The 1980s saw the rise in popularity of these larger
                    suite areas, and the current COVID-19 epidemic has prompted a renaissance in size and quality.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Most of us have, knowingly or unknowingly, been much more conscientious about our hygiene in the
                    last year, and a luxurious master bathroom significantly contributes to this trend. Walk-in showers,
                    double vanities, backlit mirrors, touchless faucets, more storage, and heated flooring are becoming
                    standard.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    Read more about how to renovate your bathroom in our <a
                        href='./top-10-bathroom-design-trends-in-2022.html'> dedicated post.</a>
                </div>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Black design accents
                </h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    As time goes on, we will see more and more black accents in design and less and less white. In 2022,
                    the "bold" option of a black wall, black cabinetry, or even black outside paint will be the norm
                    rather than the exception.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The year 2022 will substantially increase the prominence of black and metallic elements. Any modern
                    or minimalist space will benefit from their added depth and edge.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Outdoor pergolas</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Evenings spent gathered around the fire pit, chats with the neighbors, backyard cookouts, etc... The
                    backyard is now more than simply an extra lawn; it's a functional home part. Since the invention of
                    outdoor heaters, they have been a popular place to spend time in all seasons.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The pergola serves as the focal point of your garden. Use it to hang lights, shield visitors from
                    the sun, and spruce up your sitting area.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Sustainable design</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    People will discover methods to make their homes greener, installing solar-powered lighting,
                    repurposing existing furniture instead of purchasing new, or creating garden areas.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    More people will consider adding innovative home features and technology to their homes this year.
                    Many solutions may be more expensive initially but save money long-term, from Tesla charging
                    stations to eco-flushing toilets.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Bright wallpaper statements
                </h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    You're falling behind the times if you're still using a tropical beach picture as a Zoom call
                    backdrop. It's time to have a more lasting impact. Many homeowners nowadays try out wallpaper with a
                    strong statement and a more vibrant colour palette for the whole room or house. There has been a
                    shift in attitudes toward the wallpaper, which is no longer considered dated or tacky.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Using vibrant hues can brighten up any space in your house. People will always come up with creative
                    methods to inject colour into their environments, whether via a painted accent wall, a quirky
                    wallpaper design, a colourful couch, or a wacky tile backsplash.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Vintage elements
                </h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Many homeowners are hesitant to make new purchases due to supply scarcity concerns after the prior
                    year's events. The use of restored or antique furnishings may give a room a sense of history and
                    character (and help you avoid shipping delays).

                <h3 class="post-subtitle">Glass walls</h3>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    After spending almost, a year inside due to the epidemic, residents want to feel as if they're
                    outside," explains interior designer Peter Rossi. Glass walls, whether they're on the inside or
                    outside, may make a house seem more open and welcoming. Glass partitions may help a home look more
                    relaxed while yet providing privacy for its inhabitants.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Why subject yourself to an annual construction zone when everything can be done at once? That's how
                    the majority of house owners feel about the year 2022.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Instead of saving up for a succession of little improvements, you may now execute a massive project
                    with the help of improved finance alternatives that enable you to tap into your future equity.
