                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Looking for new bathroom design ideas for 2023? Whether you’re in the middle of a new build project
                    or if you plan to
                    renovate your home’s bathroom, the year 2023 comes with endless ideas. Going beyond spaces for
                    showering or bathing,
                    bathrooms are certainly among the most used rooms in any home and because of this, the bathroom has
                    transformed into a
                    space focused on relaxation, health and wellness. This space has become our stylish sanctuary for
                    all-important
                    mindfulness and self-care and for this reason, we started to give as much attention to it as we do
                    to the main rooms of
                    the house, after all – a breathtaking space can give you a little boost in the mornings and a moment
                    of peace in the
                    evenings
                    The following bathroom trends for 2023 apply to a multitude of design styles and can work with a
                    variety of bathroom
                    sizes. No matter if you love contemporary, minimalist or glamorous interiors, there’s sure to be
                    something to suit your
                    tastes – you only need to discover it!
                </p>
                <div class="post-highlight">
                    These are going to be the five biggest bathroom trends for 2023, according to bathroom designers /
                    interior designers.

                <h2 class="post-subtitle">Spa inspired bathroom design - an oasis of calm in your bathroom</h2>
                <img class="post-img" src="/assets/img/bathroom/spa-inspired-bathroom-design.jpeg"
                    alt="spa inspired bathroom design with freestanding bath">
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    In recent years, many of us have realised the untapped potential of our bathrooms as wellness
                    spaces, and this has led
                    several designers to consider that a top trend for 2023 will be turning the bathroom into the
                    ultimate retreat. Seeing
                    the bathroom as the ultimate retreat, 2023 bathroom design is all about personalization, consider
                    them as spaces in
                    which to take care of your body and relax your mind.
                </p>
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    There is an ever-changing mindset when it comes to bathroom design; instead of seeing bathrooms as a
                    place with clear
                    tasks, clients are looking to create lounge spaces where freestanding bathtubs are surrounded by
                    tables for candles and
                    glasses of wine alongside comfortable seating, establishing the bathroom as more than just a place
                    to primp and wash up
                    and for this reason, the spa has become a main inspirational motif.
                </p>
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Steam showers are becoming more and more popular and benches are often requested in bathrooms in
                    order to encourage
                    relaxation and create a luxurious statement. Also, open shelves where you can roll towels as you
                    would see at a luxury
                    spa, and natural and dimmable lighting with soft inviting colours to help it feel zen, are similar
                    spa-inspired trends.
                    All these elements from the world of hospitality combine to create a sumptuous private space for the
                    homeowner to escape
                    at the end of a long day.

                <h2 class="post-subtitle">Get inspired by Terrazzo</h2>
                <img src="/assets/img/bathroom/bathroom-design-trend-terrazzo.jpeg"
                    alt="bathroom renovated with terrazzo tiles on the floor" class="post-img">

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Terrazzo is among the top bathroom tile trends of 2023 having an impressive comeback. Terrazzo decor
                    is currently having
                    a resurgence, it has a timeless finish that's been around for centuries. Apart from being available
                    in almost every
                    colour and size, each terrazzo style is unique, all being equally attractive and also very
                    sustainable.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">'We love working with terrazzo and one of its main benefits is just how
                    flexible it can be,’ says Nicoline Sandwith,
                    director of Studio Ogee.</div>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Its characteristic flecks give a sense of retro style to contemporary bathrooms, meaning that you
                    can add a unique pop
                    even if a full bathroom renovation isn’t on your list.
                    This style works on so many levels in terms of providing the colour, pattern and a sense of movement
                    and dynamism - to
                    get all this you can match the wall with the floor to double the impact
                    If you are looking for interesting bathroom ideas without being overpowering, terrazzo is for sure a
                    great choice. This
                    material brings colour, texture and individuality to a bathroom – while being incredibly practical
                    and hardwearing. For
                    example, in a long and narrow bathroom, you can create by using the right tiles, a focal point that
                    draws the length of
                    the room, while its light colours and subtle pattern enlarge the space
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    It's important to note that terrazzo is a good conductor of heat, so it works well with underfloor
                    heating, which will
                    help keep the cold away and keep the floor dry.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The bathroom trends of 2023 propose we embrace the industrial style and enjoy a bit of steampunk
                    flair and, instead of
                    minimising or hiding the presence of pipework, turn them into a feature.
                    Industrial bathroom design has a focus on strong and tough materials. A bathroom that follows this
                    design has less sleek
                    chrome, and more brass, steel or copper. If you're thinking of including any other materials, aged
                    wood with a slightly
                    tarnished look is a good idea.

                    The industrial style has its correspondent in the well-known image of New York lofts and to have a
                    bathroom with this
                    design, a key element to have is a bare brick wall.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    We recommend having only one wall with exposed brick in your bathroom so as not to load too much
                    visually.
                </div>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Dark grey tones are the specific colours of this style. We recommend a black frame shower screen and
                    grey or black
                    accessories. The industrial bathroom is all about moving away from elegant and fancy furniture and
                    embracing a slightly
                    more chaotic and rustic design style. One easy way to get this look is by fitting open shelving to
                    hold all your
                    bathroom essentials.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Many designers noted that bathrooms are finally getting that mix of old and new to create a more
                    inviting, warmer and
                    cosy space that is comfortable enough to spend an hour or two in at a time
                    “We are seeing some interesting trends in bathroom design lately, especially when it comes to
                    incorporating antique
                    furniture in lieu of millwork, and we are also installing art above bathroom vanities, leaving
                    mirrors to be placed in
                    more creative ways,” says New York-based designer <a href="https://www.davidfrazier.co/"
                        target="_blank">David Frazier</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    If you are about to refurbish your bathroom, you have to know that wood is becoming a popular
                    material, from flooring to
                    open shelving and cabinetry. Also, there is a great interest in vintage items and stone sinks to
                    give the bathroom an
                    accent of beautifully aged jewellery and all these put together create a one-of-a-kind space.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    If this bathroom design caught your attention and suits your style, you must know that the trend
                    uses three or four
                    different materials to create a layered space that looks as if it has evolved over time.
                    In 2023, expect to see a lot more natural wood on bathroom vanities. This increased interest in
                    wooden elements lead to
                    the rapid growth of modern organic style and warm colours that we have seen in the last couple of
                    years.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    It seems that 2023 is the year of the shower. Designers agreed and identified that the trends for
                    this year are heading
                    towards an elevated shower routine.
                    With increasingly busy lives and convenience as a priority, we're opting for showers over baths and
                    because of this, we
                    are starting to give them the attention that they deserve.

                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    This being said, what do you prefer - wet rooms or walk-in showers?
                </div>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The difference between a wet room and a walk-in shower is that in a wet room, the space is
                    completely open plan and the
                    water flows away through a drain in the floor, while a walk-in shower differs simply because of the
                    inclusion of a low
                    profile shower tray and typically has one or two glass screens.
                    Wet rooms and walk-in showers offer a great alternative to the traditional bathroom layout and the
                    costs vary depending
                    on your needs. Both are ideal for small bathrooms, help to create space and offer more flexibility
                    for layout. Compared
                    to traditional shower cabins, you can expand as much as you need to create ample showering space.

                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Offering a contemporary and stylish option for bathroom design, both wet rooms and walk-in showers
                    exude luxury and can
                    positively impact the value of your property. The minimal fittings mean low maintenance and
                    durability.
