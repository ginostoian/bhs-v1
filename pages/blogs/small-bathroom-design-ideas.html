                <h2 class="post-subtitle">How To Make A Small Bathroom Look Bigger</h2>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Because we want to make every inch count and make you forget how small your bathroom is, this post
                    also includes tips on
                    how to make a small space look bigger. We want to prove that with some clever design ideas, tiny
                    bathrooms have tons of
                    potential not just to be incredibly functional and charming but super-stylish too.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Until recently, small bathrooms always required a compromise and most of the time we had to give up
                    the bathtub, the
                    first victim in the space battle. Another major problem was represented by the storage spaces, most
                    of the time
                    non-existent.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    When it comes to small bathroom design, clever planning, which includes everything from smart
                    storage options to fitting
                    choices, to layout, is key to ensuring that even a tiny space can still feel spacious. Through these
                    small bathroom
                    ideas, we want to go beyond the idea of ​​making the most of the available space and we want to show
                    that bold design
                    elements fit very well even in tiny rooms and that stylish finishes that are also practical are the
                    icing on the cake.

                    compromise
                    on aesthetics. While there are some limitations design-wise, small bathrooms can still be
                    spectacular by making the most
                    of the space you have with clever storage, layout, and use of colour.'

                    Read on to find out how to create and design the small bathroom of your dreams.
                </p>

                <h2 class="post-subtitle">Choose A Light Color Scheme</h2>
                <img src="/assets/img/bathroom/light-colour-scheme-bathroom-design.jpeg"
                    alt="light colour scheme for bathroom design" class="post-img" loading="lazy">

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Most of the time light colours make a space feel bigger. If you have difficulties in choosing a
                    design to decorate a
                    small bathroom, just keep it simple with natural and soft shades. Opt for accessories and furniture
                    with clean lines and
                    keep the room as clutter-free as possible to create the illusion of space.
                </p>

                    <a href="https://victoriaplum.com/" target="_blank">Ruth Foster, Interior Designer at Victoria
                        Plum</a> says, 'Neutral décor in the bathroom has always been popular, however
                    even more so in smaller spaces. Adopting light shades like taupe, cream and white will create a
                    lighter and brighter
                    bathroom, making it appear larger than it is. If you keep this in mind when choosing the colour of
                    your wall and floor
                    tiles, you can create a warm and harmonious design with timeless elegance.'

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Mirrors always make a room feel bigger by creating the illusion of spaciousness. You will be
                    surprised how much a mirror
                    can open up a room, especially if your bathroom is not only small but also dark.
                    A wall-to-wall mirror will bounce the natural light around the room and make the whole space feel
                    bigger.

                    space and shape of your bathroom. If space is limited, having a shower over the bath is a practical
                    way of ensuring you
                    can still have both, which can be important in a family bathroom. If you are going for this option,
                    specially designed
                    baths (L or P shaped so that they provide a larger area when showering) can work.'

                    models such as boat
                    baths can be a great option when used with either a riser kit or a ceiling-mounted shower. To stop
                    water splashing
                    everywhere, team it with an oval shower ring and shower curtain.'

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Natural light is one of our favourite tricks when we want to give the feeling of more space. In a
                    small room, natural
                    light is too important to block it with curtains. If the space allows you to keep the windows bare
                    then feel free to do
                    this.

                    One of the best tips in any small room is to think vertically. A smart way in making a bathroom look
                    bigger is by adding
                    vertical wall tiles. In this way, your small bathroom will look higher and therefore bigger. Also,
                    hang art vertically

                    The dimensions of the small bathroom space you have and what the eye perceives are not necessarily
                    the same thing, due
                    to the tricks we can use to fool the true dimensions. Play with the boundaries of perception by
                    matching the wall with
                    the floor to double the impact, tiling with the same design will make it harder to distinguish where
                    each begins, thus
                    making the space feel larger.

                    creating the illusion of a larger space, however, we can't deny how fabulous and trendy darker paint

                    Black gives depth and creates an illusion of a larger space and also will draw attention to the

                    reason, we must be very careful how we illuminate such a room, light being the star.

                    James Roberts at Sanctuary Bathrooms says, 'Although it might seem a bad idea to use dark colours in
                    a small space,
                    there are ways to implement it without it looking gloomy! If you want to go dark on the walls, add
                    pops of light colours
                    through furniture and fittings. With botanicals set to be big in 2023, try a dark green with some
                    accessorising plants
                    in various shades to add dimension.'

                    Many times, in small bathrooms we encounter problems when we want to install a shower and a separate

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    However, there are a couple of clever ideas like wet rooms and folding shower screens that take up
                    much less room than a
                    typical shower. For these, there is no need for bulky shower trays and can easily blend into the
                    aesthetics of the rest
                    of the room.

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Consistency is key. Use the same type of tiles for both the wall and the floor, and choose glass
                    shower doors — or even
                    no shower doors to keep it feeling open and breezy. Don't forget to use every element to the
                    maximum, choosing
                    multifunctional furniture and accessories to store as many things as possible. Visually play with
                    things vertically or
                    even by choosing a bold and playful wallpaper

                    It's a matter of taste. Most of the time, white is recommended, this colour expands a room the most,

                    can also provide depth and give an impressive state of comfort, highlighting the accessories in the

                    Ed Norris, National Sales Development Manager at Mereway Bathrooms says,' There are no definitive
                    rules between colour
                    choice and bathroom size, what’s most important is that the palette you select reflects the mood you
                    wish to set and
                    works with the rest of your home. Electric colours and interesting finishes such as soft and gloss
                    matt will add a wow
                    factor. If you’d prefer a calmer aesthetic, try a woodgrain effect in organic tones such as mussel
                    and greens, or go
                    towards Japandi styles with blacks, browns, and whites.'

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    James Roberts, Director at Sanctuary Bathrooms says, 'Pastel shades are great for small bathrooms as
                    they help to
                    maximise light. These are great for walls, but can also work with standard white walls in the form
                    of your furniture and
                    fittings. Consider creating a colour palette of around 4 complimentary colours to stick to for all
                    your bathroom décor
                    to avoid clashing and create a harmonious small space. Bright, fresh tones are always great for
                    small bathrooms too, as
                    they can help ensure the light gets around the room to make the space appear bigger.'

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Ed Norris, National Sales Development Manager at Mereway Bathrooms says, 'A common issue with
                    smaller bathrooms is the
                    lack of space for toiletries and fresh towels. Utilise the storage around your sanitaryware;
                    cupboards will keep things
                    neatly tucked away but remember to introduce a segment of open shelving too to add a visual relief
                    that still provides a
                    place to put things but helps the space feel airier. Keeping storage all within one area will bring
                    a focus to the
                    layout and let you move around more freely.'

                    James Roberts, Director at Sanctuary Bathrooms, adds, 'Consider going wall-hung with your fittings
                    and fixtures. Many
                    features - from the toilet and basin to accessories like toilet roll holders and toilet brushes –
                    now come in
                    wall-mounted styles. Lifting everything off the ground provides extra space and extends your floor
                    outwards, making it
                    look bigger. If you’re low on space, a shower enclosure that opens out into the room is going to be
                    a problem. Sliding
                    door shower enclosures are perfect for these occasions, as they don’t require any additional room to
                    operate. If you’re
                    low on space, a wet room can be a great option because it removes the footprint of a standard
                    shower, making the space
