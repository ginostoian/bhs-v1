                    design</h2>
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Without a doubt, lighting plays an important role in setting the tone of any space and the right
                    lighting design can
                    make all the difference. From minimalist and sleek designs to luxurious oases, bathrooms are places
                    where we can truly
                    rejuvenate and relax and because of this, few well-placed fixtures can make all the difference in
                    terms of function and
                    style.
                </p>
                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    When it comes to interior lighting, bathroom lighting is probably given the least consideration of
                    all the rooms in the
                    house, but in recent years we have started to put more and more emphasis on these details. Good
                    lighting in your
                    bathroom helps create a place to recharge and relax and when it's done right, the payoff is great.
                    After all, this is
                    the place where you start and end your day. Starting from this idea, we are taking a look at some of
                    the hottest
                    lighting trends for 2023.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    It is not enough just to invest in design, because even the most carefully decorated room can be
                    destroyed by wrongly
                    chosen lighting. At the same time, lighting can be a secret weapon for interior design enthusiasts.
                    The lamps set the
                    atmosphere you need but also offer those small important touches in the decoration of a room.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Ample lights are recommended to be placed where it is needed for showers, shaving, or putting on
                    makeup, while other
                    light sources enhance the overall mood of the room. Applied with precision, bathroom lighting ideas
                    have the capacity to
                    influence a person during different points of the day, to revitalise in the morning and to relax in
                    the evening
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    The latest bathroom lighting trends will offer inspiration and help you illuminate your bathroom
                    ideas with style.

                <h2 class="post-subtitle">Backlit Mirrors</h2>
                <img class="post-img" src="/assets/img/bathroom/backlit-mirrors-bathroom-design.png"
                    alt="backlit mirror in beautifully designed bathroom" loading="lazy">

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    One of the easiest ways to bring an element of sophistication and glamour into the decor of the
                    bathroom is by
                    incorporating backlighting behind a mirror frame. Not only does this give the space more visual
                    interest, but it also
                    allows you to adjust the atmosphere to suit your needs and one of the best parts about backlighting
                    is that it ensures
                    even distribution of light around the mirror, unlike wall-mounted lights on the sides or top of the
                    mirror.
                </p>

                <h2 class="post-subtitle">Minimalistic Interior Lamps</h2>
                <img src="/assets/img/bathroom/minimalistic-interior-lamps-for-bathrooms.png" loading="lazy"
                    alt="2 lamps iluminating the bathroom" class="post-img">

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The use of minimalistic interior lamps on bathroom walls trend seems to continue in 2023 as well.
                    This design remains to
                    everyone's liking because, besides the peaceful and spa-like atmosphere, this style also saves some
                    valuable space. The
                    same effect is given by using LED strip lights, these being often applied to create unique accent
                    lighting and also they
                    are perfect for highlighting certain features in the bathroom, such as a beautiful mirror or a
                    decorative element.
                </p>

                <h2 class="post-subtitle">Dramatic Lighting</h2>
                <img src="/assets/img/bathroom/dramatic-bathroom-light.png" alt="handmade chandelier in bathroom"
                    class="post-img" loading="lazy">

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    If you’re looking for something truly unique, unusual shapes, surprising materials and bold colours
                    can all make
                    dramatic or unexpected lighting fixtures, all adding personality to your bathroom. Taking this into
                    consideration,
                    unusual shapes and styles will add interest to simple bathroom colour schemes without losing
                    practicality.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    At the same time, this design can be overwhelming to the eye, so be careful not to use too much
                    decor. A few well-chosen
                    pieces will have a much greater impact than a multitude of pieces that will give a tiring and loaded
                    state.
                </p>

                <h2 class="post-subtitle">Make A Modern Statement</h2>
                <img src="/assets/img/bathroom/modern-bathroom-lighting.png" alt="bold light fitting in bathroom"
                    class="post-img" loading="lazy">

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The lighting design we choose in the house can give us the desired atmosphere every day. As we have
                    noticed, the trend
                    of 2023 is to incorporate elements in the bathroom that we would normally choose for the main room
                    of the house. For
                    example, choosing a sputnik light,
                    such a modern design might typically be placed in a main room, but the trend is absolutely that if
                    you love a light,
                    there is no reason why you cannot place that element wherever you want, even in the bathroom
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    Make the light the star of the show and do not be afraid to accessorise the bathroom space with bold
                    accents
                </div>

                <h2 class="post-subtitle">Wall lights - a soft approach</h2>

                    Bathroom lighting can be more about creating an atmosphere than anything else and because the trends
                    of 2023 place a
                    great emphasis on the state offered during the bath, wall lights are in trend this year.

                    Wall lights are used in bathrooms to accentuate particular areas, having a decorative purpose

                    elements are usually not the main source of light, their role is to create an atmosphere where
                    everything is about
                    switching off and relaxing.

                    Who said that chandeliers are not made for bathrooms?

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    Chandeliers in bathrooms are bold style choices that bring function with a huge gloss of flair.
                    Whether you go with a
                    sconce, a pendant or a flush mount, try to incorporate some crystal lighting into your bathroom
                    lighting set-up. From
                    mini chandeliers to show stopping crystal chandeliers, this style trend is the ideal something extra
                    for every home.
                    'You need two types of illumination: shadow-free task lighting for functional tasks and ambient
                    lighting for when you
                    simply want to lie back and enjoy a soak,' advises Peter Bowles, founder of Davey Lighting.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    The crystals will reflect the light from the light bulbs and in this way, they will create a
                    heavenly effect in your
                    bath space.

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    We recommend that the chandelier be placed in the centre of the bathroom in order to balance the
                    shower, tub and vanity
                    that line the walls. If the room has a freestanding tub, the chandelier can be hung above it, the
                    two components
                    providing the main visual point.

                    Positioned underneath a
                    wall-hung cabinet lighting can create a floating effect or can be set up to show off the surface of
                    decorative tiles.

                    Low-level PIR (Passive Infrared sensor) lighting that comes on automatically as you enter, provides
                    ideal lighting for
                    night-time visits to the bathroom without having to switch on the main lights, plus it isn’t as
                    harsh on the eyes,

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    There are four main lighting aspects to consider when choosing bathroom lighting, and layering these
                    effectively will
                    provide the very best illumination. The four areas are:

                    <li>
                        <strong>Task</strong> refers to helpful lighting for functional activities, such as shaving or
                        applying makeup.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Ambience</strong> refers to lighting that brings harmony and balance to the space,
                        essential in the bathroom where designers
                        often seek to build a state of relaxation and disconnection

                        <strong>Feature</strong> lighting gives the space personality. Techniques such as positioning or
                        incorporating a light over a bath can
                        say a lot about a person's style. From a spa-like to a fresh and invigorating environment.

                <h2 class="post-subtitle">Do I Need A Special Light For The Bathroom?</h2>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    More than any other room in the home, the bathroom represents a space with a higher degree of risk
                    through the prism of
                    the humid environment and safety needs to be a prime concern when installing lighting in a bathroom.
                </p>

                <p class="post-paragraph">
                    We recommend looking out for the IP Code when you choose the lights. This classifies and rates the
                    degree of protection
                    against water and also for dust. The IP rating you need depends on the area in the bathroom that we
                    want to illuminate.
                    For example, IP65 can be used in any area of a bathroom or wet room, while IP44 is only suitable
                    60cm from the water
                    source.
                </p>

                <div class="post-highlight">
                    Before buying the lighting fixtures for the bathroom, we recommend consulting with electricians to
                    ensure you have
                    up-to-date safety information.
